# Team Green Koalas CS410 Group Project

For this group project, Team Green Koalas will be improving the [Educational Web System](http://timan102.cs.illinois.edu/explanation//slide/cs-410/0).  The Educational Web System is a tool recently developed by some of the students in Professor Zhai’s research group that allows students to view all lecture slides from course CS 410 (Text Information Systems).  This tool supports choosing a specific lecture’s worth of lecture slides, sequential navigation through individual slides, searching for relevant slides, navigating to other recommended slides, and finding term and phrase definitions from the textbook.

Specifically, we will develop the ability to allow for bulk downloading of slides.  This simple enhancement would provide concrete value to future students, instructors, and other users of this system for years to come.

Understanding that the expectation is for each group member to spend around 20 hours of effort on this assignment, if we are able to complete the bulk download in less than 60 hours (which seems likely), we will then move onto another topic, such as improving performance or expanding the content to include slides and textbooks from other courses.  This could potentially expand the user base to students and instructors of other courses as well.
